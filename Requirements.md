# System Requirements
The recommended ways to create NativeScript Applications is either through the [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) or through the [Telerik AppBuilder](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder).

# Supported iOS Versions
The iOS Runtime supports officially iOS7.1+. The metadata however is generated with the latest SDK. The metadata contains information about API availability so NativeScript allows you to both use the latest APIs, and if necessary, detect and degrade gracefully on lower iOS versions.

# Supported Application Binary Interfaces (ABI)
Currently supported are the following CPU instruction sets:
 - armv7
 - arm64
